ScriptMaven is an intelligent web application designed to streamline the creation of educational video scripts. Leveraging advanced language models, it automates the process of content planning and scriptwriting, making it a valuable tool for educators, content creators, and corporate trainers.

#### Key Features:

1. **Content Planning**: The app generates a detailed content plan based on an article or textual input. It outlines the video's structure, breaks it down into sections, and allocates time for each segment.
  
2. **Automated Scriptwriting**: Once the content plan is ready, ScriptMaven crafts a comprehensive script for each section of the video. This includes introductory lines, key points, data or examples, and transitions between sections.

3. **Customization**: Users can specify the video style (e.g., YouTube, Corporate), the tone (e.g., For Students, CEO Level), and the video length, allowing for a tailored video blueprint.

4. **API Integration**: The app integrates with OpenAI's language models to ensure high-quality, coherent, and informative scripts.

#### How it Works:

1. **User Input**: Users input their OpenAI API Key, choose video style, tone, length, and content type, and provide the base article or content.
  
2. **Generate Plan**: Clicking the "Generate Plan" button triggers the language model to create a content plan based on the given article and user-defined parameters.
  
3. **View Scripts**: After generating the content plan, the app calls the language model again to produce detailed scripts for each section, which are then displayed on the UI.

By automating the labor-intensive process of planning and scriptwriting, ScriptMaven empowers content creators to focus on what they do bestâ€”educating and engaging their audience.
