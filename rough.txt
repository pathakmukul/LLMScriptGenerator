prompt = f""" Provided is a JSON ({json_result}) with three entries illustrating product (recommended product), prod_desc (product description), and oppr (potential dollar earnings/savings where relevant). Craft a 10-20 word statement for each product, emphasizing how it can create an earnings/savings opportunity (Opportunity from JSON) for the {KPI}. The language should be suitable for a sales presentation, avoiding excessive exaggeration. Deliver the text for each product in the following JSON format: {{ "text_1": "text for product 1", "text_2": "text for product 2", "text_3": "text for product 3", "text_4": {{ "summary": "In 10-15 words, provide a high-level summary describing how a merchant, {merchant_filter}, is performing based on Client Vs Benchmark Variance value {rolling_var} in relation to the {KPI} benchmark compared to its peers.", "performance_indicators": {{ "green": [ "List 2-3 positive performance points here, each as a separate string in this array" ], "red": [ "List 2-3 negative performance points or areas for improvement here, each as a separate string in this array" ] }} }} }} Avoid using quotes in your response. Maintain clarity and brevity. No unnecessary elaborations. NOTE: - If {rolling_var} (Unit BPS for fraud, chargeback & % for Approval) exceeds the benchmark for FRAUD & Chargeback, it signifies underperformance. If it falls below, it signifies better performance. This is reversed for other KPIs like Approval Rate. - For FRAUD & Chargeback recommended products, use phrases such as "potential savings" instead of "earnings". - For Approval rate recommended products (text_1, text_2, text_3), say "earning" instead of "savings". - Avoid overly optimistic language. Aim for professionalism as the purpose is a client pitch. EXAMPLE FOR text_4 summary: "Air France's fraud rates fell short by 2.46 BPS compared to the benchmark, indicating potential improvements." OR "Air France's approval rate lags slightly behind the industry benchmark by 20%, signifying scope for enhancement." EXAMPLES for text_1, text_2, text_3: - "Product1 will help substantially improve client's approval rate and could provide a significant boost of {oppr} in increased sales." - "By securing client's sensitive information, Visa Token Service could save around $9M from fraud-related losses." - "Visa Secure EMV 3DS reduces operational costs and heightens sales, projecting an opportunity to save $5.7M." Use vocabulary such as: "Actionable insights", "Data-driven services", "Improve fraud and authorization performance", "Security technology", "Protecting consumers' sensitive information", "Fraud detection and management tool", "Increase approval rate", "Address declines", "Reducing fraud and related disputes", "Recurring transactions", "Risk assessment", "Reduce Chargeback" Please maintain a professional tone and avoid overly optimistic language.
